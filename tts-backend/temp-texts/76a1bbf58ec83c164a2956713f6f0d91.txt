The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.
The only time you fail is when you fall down and stay down.
ATTITUDE is a little thing that makes a big difference.
Believe you CAN and you're halfway there.
If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more.
Positive anything is better than negative nothing.
Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll start having positive results.
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events, and outcomes. It is a catalyst, and it sparks extraordinary results.
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.
The only difference between a good day and a bad day is your attitude.
